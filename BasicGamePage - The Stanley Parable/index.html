        <p><strong>The Stanley Parable</strong> is a first person exploration game. You will play as Stanley, 
            and you will not play as Stanley. You will follow a story, you will not follow a story. 
            You will have a choice, you will have no choice. The game will end, the game will never end. 
            Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then 
            broken again. This world was not made for you to understand.  But as you explore, slowly, 
            meaning begins to arise, the paradoxes might start to make sense, perhaps you are powerful 
            after all. The game is not here to fight you; it is inviting you to dance.

        <h2>Quote</h2>
        <blockquote>
            Effortlessly inventive, frequently surprising and consistently hilarious. The Stanley Parable shows how to make a story about game stories.
